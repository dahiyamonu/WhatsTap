# WhatsTap

WhatsTap is an open-source React-based project that streamlines the process of initiating a conversation on WhatsApp without needing to save the contact's number in your phone. Users can simply enter a phone number in the app, click "chat," and be directed straight to the WhatsApp chat window without adding the number to their contacts. Additionally, WhatsTap allows users to save contacts in their browserâ€™s local storage. The latest feature also generates a QR code, enabling instant chat by scanning the code.
